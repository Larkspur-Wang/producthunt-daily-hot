Product Hunt Daily Hot is a GitHub Action-based automation tool that generates a daily Markdown file summarizing the top products from Product Hunt and automatically commits it to a GitHub repository. The project aims to help users quickly view the daily Product Hunt leaderboard and provide more detailed product information.

In this enhanced version, we have added the ability to automatically update the data to Feishu Bitable and support for using Dify's API as an alternative to OpenAI's API.

The leaderboard is automatically updated daily at 3:00 PM Beijing Time. You can view it [üåê here](https://decohack.com/category/producthunt/).
